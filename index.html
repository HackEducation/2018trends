<p>2018 marks the ninth year in which I&#8217;ve reviewed the most important &#8220;trends&#8221; in education technology from the previous twelve months. (You can look at the topics I&#8217;ve covered in previous years here on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">research.hackeducation.com</a>.)</p>

<p>Don't worry, guys. I'm quitting after ten.</p>

<p>This project includes <a href="http://2018trends.hackeducation.com/blog">a blog</a> where you can read supplemental stories about how I work as well as my thoughts throughout the year on these (and other) &#8220;trends.&#8221; You can also read more about the investments and investors that fuel these powerful education stories at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>.</p>
