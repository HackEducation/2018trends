<p>I've wrapped up my series "<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com">The Stories We Were Told about Education Technology (2017)</a>," so it's time to start paying attention to the ones we will hear in 2018. </p>

<p>This is the ninth time doing this massive project. I think I will quit after ten.</p>

<p>I plan to keep this blog updated regularly throughout the year. I'll post thoughts as the year progresses on what I'm seeing as emerging trends and storylines. I'll also link to all the weekly news summaries and weekly newsletters, so that it's easier to compile the data when I start working on the year-end series in December.</p>
