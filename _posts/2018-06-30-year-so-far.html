<p>We&#8217;re halfway through 2018, which means I need to start thinking about this massive end-of-year project and start identifying the dominant trends and narratives. </p>

<p><em>What are the stories we&#8217;re hearing about ed-tech? (Who&#8217;s telling those stories? Who&#8217;s paying for them to be told?)</em></p>

<p>Due to that other big project I&#8217;m currently working on &#8211; <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/28/mit-university-press"><em>Teaching Machines</em></a> &#8211; I am going to have to make this year&#8217;s review a little shorter than usual. (And honestly, writing <a href="http://teachingmachin.es/2018/06/28/mit-university-press">last year&#8217;s series</a> was terribly grueling because of this awful combination of authoritarian politics and authoritarian technology that we&#8217;re experiencing.) </p>

<p>I&#8217;m just going to pick five rather than ten stories to focus on this year. So far, I think they&#8217;ll include these:</p>

<ul>
<li>School safety (e.g. guns, surveillance)</li>
<li>Robots in the classroom (e.g. algorithms, Alexa)</li>
<li>The business of ed-tech</li>
<li>Social-emotional learning (e.g. &#8220;mindsets&#8221;)</li>
<li>Job training</li>
</ul>

<p>These might change, of course, once I look more closely at my notes from the year and at where the money has gone...</p>
